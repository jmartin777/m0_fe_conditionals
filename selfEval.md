# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

- **Im feeling confident in my ability to apply comparison operators in the proper syntax.Im becomming more aware and able - picking out key words in a word problem and translating them into a conditional using comparison operators . Now to refine this knowledge and apply these operators in different ways when it comes to defining a conditional and when how I need to apply them.**

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- **Its been really great being able to brush up on my logical operators gain and again. Ive wrote them and posted them on my wall, which helps me glance and practice memorization. I feel there becomming more fluid when I am deciphering and translating them into code. Math teacher would be proud.**

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- **At one point, I felt I was still grasping If statements. But now I feel its becomming more intuitive as I repeat the order of processes and seeing the overall layout again and again when applying them. I feel theres a more solid understanding when im logically speaking the problem and then translating if statements into code. Ive been taking more time into this segment and practicing multiple ways and variables to have a better understaning when im translatting and applying multiple conditions within an if statement.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- **I  started this assignment at 1:30 pm and finished up around 4:00 pm, I really wanted to take my time after writing succesful code with the outputs I was expecting and switching up variables for different outcomes or different conditions to flex this knowledge. This lines up with the rest of my schedule for today considering my Pairing Session will be later in the evening(7:30pm MT). This has given me time to reflect and keep practicing for the day while maintaing a self-care routine through the day.**

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- **I still want to keep practicing and implement todays segment to the point where it becomes an intuitive when it comes to using for statements and applying Logical/Comparison operators. I definitly feel familiar with this process , now to feel fully confident when i approach this scenario in a live-scenario.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- **How often do we use for If statements in the coding world and what is some active ways to keep flexing this knowledge and adding onto that**?
